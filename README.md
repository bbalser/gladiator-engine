Read the comments.  I probably got carried away, but my change is an answer
to your question about mocking libraries.  If you'd prefer, throw it out
and we'll just use Dice.  (I did pass your test)

After creating the RandomFacade, I realized that you may have intended
for the Dice class to be the facade.  Sorry.  Hate to throw out my pedantry
so I'm going to leave it.  If you want to rename RandomFacade to Die and
drop the Die class, I'm cool with that.

I checked the net about the singular of dice.  In summary, die is the singular
of dice, but only dice-nerds know that.  "Normal" people use dice for both
singular and plural.  But, do you REALLY want to be normal?
